<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This project is about Real-Time bi directional client communication - more precisely chatting like appication.

`Poetry` - dependency and package manager used to manage dependencies and virtual env on the project.

`Makefile` (*NIX build tool `make`) - was used to shortcut project linters, syntax formatters, checking vulnerabilities and etc...

`Swagger UI` - used for documentation & testing of the endpoints. You can use any other WebSocket client to connect WebSocket server host. Project doesn't contain any client side (no front end) markup to handle connections.

`Django Channels` - was used as an underlying base layer of the WebSocket protocol. 

Underneath `Django Channels` - is capable to apply a queue like brokers to handle messages asynchronously (like `Redis Queue`). 
However, I was not able find any native integration of `Django Channels` and `Apache Kafka` (per task requirement), therefore default `InMemoryChannelLayer` is used with refactored whole chatting architecure.

`Session cookies` (signed) - are used to authenticate user and issue a `session_id` on the client side (per requirement default `django-auth` must be used).

`Environment variables` - are located in the `.env` file of every project layer. Mostly this file overrides global container's environment vars. However some globals are considered not to take a part in `.env` file.

`CGI Application sever (GUnicorn)` - had an issue with binding both for `WebSocket` and `HTTP` host, therefore development server is used (default `manage runserver`).

`ApplyKafkaProducerMiddleware` - additional middleware layer was added in order to iject `singleton` kafka producer object into a `request` object, before every request on a predefined endpoints.

`volumes` - In order to persist data in the container, `volumes` was used for `database`, `logging`, `static server files`, `kafka socket`

`BCryptSHA256PasswordHasher` - used as a default hash algorithm.

Inspiration was to strictly stick to `DDD` and `Clean Architecture`. Hence some part of projects and folder-structure might be implicitly abstracted than usual `Django`'s `MVT`. 

`Apache Kafka Consumer service` - is a python project `path=./consumer` a dedicated service on a dedicated container environmet, listening for message broker on a certain topic, consuming broker's produced messages as a seperate service.










<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.
Docker Deamon is used to manage project deployments.

### Prerequisites

Docker Deamon must be installed and enabled.
Make build tool preferred, but not required

* Docker Deamon - GNU/Linux
  ```
  apt install docker-ce
  sudo systemctl start docker
  sudo systemctl enable docker
  ````
* Docker Deamon - MacOS ARM
  ```
  curl https://desktop.docker.com/mac/main/arm64/Docker.dmg --output ./Docker.dmg
  ````

* Docker Deamon - MacOS Intel
  ```
  curl https://desktop.docker.com/mac/main/amd64/Docker.dmg --output ./Docker.dmg
  ````


### Installation & Deployement

* with Make build tool
  ```sh
  make build-images
  make run-containers
  ```

* without Make build tool
  ```
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml build 
  docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up
  ```




<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Navigate `http://0.0.0.0:8000` - in the browser, you will automatically redirected to the `Swagger UI` documentation page. Default port both for HTTP and WebSocket is `8000`
